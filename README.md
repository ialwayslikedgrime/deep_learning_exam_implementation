## Deep Learning Exam Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of my Deep Learning exam project for the course Machine Learning, Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Exam session: June 2025).

I scored full marks on this exam.


## ðŸ“„ Exam Context

The exam consisted of a problem structured into six open questions, covering the full modeling pipeline:

	1.	Model â€” choice of the most appropriate architecture and rationale

	2.	Input â€” preprocessing strategy, input types, shapes, and value domains

	3.	Output â€” design of output layers and justification

	4.	Loss â€” choice of loss functions and label formatting

	5.	Model Configuration â€” layer composition, hyperparameters, optimization strategy

	6.	Evaluation â€” assessing generalization on unseen data

Students first answered these questions in writing, with no access to the dataset, then had to deliver a Colab notebook implementation that faithfully adhered to the stated design choices, with no changes allowed afterwards.

ðŸ§  My Solution

	â€¢	Model Architecture: Multi-input, multi-output neural network (Functional API, Keras)

	â€¢	Inputs:

	â€¢	Text reviews (tokenized, padded sequences â†’ Embedding + LSTM branch)

	â€¢	Categorical metadata (seasons, reviewer continent, hotel popularity quartiles â†’ Dense layers branch)

	â€¢	Outputs:

	â€¢	Binary classification (Good vs. Bad review, sigmoid activation)

	â€¢	Regression (Review score, linear activation)

	â€¢	Loss Functions: Binary cross-entropy + Mean Squared Error (weighted sum)

	â€¢	Optimization: Adam optimizer with tuned hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout, batch size, LSTM units)
	
	â€¢	Evaluation: Baseline training, random search for hyperparameter tuning, and 5-fold cross-validation




The original dataset (`input_data.pkl`) is no longer publicly available. (This is why there is not a requirements.txt anymore here)
